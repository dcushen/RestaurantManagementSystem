# RestaurantManagementSystem
A project built for 3rd year major group project by David Cushen, Mehreen Malik and Mirza Rizvanovic. 

The purpose of this project was to offer a software solution to the every day problems and running tasks faced inside of a restaurant. 
This application allows users to clock in and out, view rosters and times scheduled to work, take orders which are then sent to the kitchen,
edit the menu on the fly with a live inventory update. This application also allows a chef to add ingridients for their dish which then uses
and API to calculate the amount of calories in the dish (+= 100kcal). The application is lightweight, built in Android Studio using PHP, Volley,
MySQL and the Java language. 

Available in the report is a full break down of why we chose to do this project and the challenges we undertook. The analysis and design is 
also discussed within the report alongisde wireframes and use case diagrams for the system we envisioned. 

To use this application, please download the APK once made available. Alternatively, you can download the Restaurant Management System folder
and load in a virtual machine or directly onto your mobile device. The application is designed to run on Android KitKat (4.4.4) or later.
